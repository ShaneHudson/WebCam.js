Hello!

This is no where near release yet, but since it will be open source anyway I see no reason why I cannot just dump my files on here :)

Most of the code does work, though probably all of it is buggy. If you read the code, do not expect to find it well written... a lot of it needs a complete rewrite since it was just to play around to see what is possible.

Feel free to submit feature requests!
